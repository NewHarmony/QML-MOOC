    "## Hybrid computation\n",
    "As fault-tolerant quantum computers are far from being available, the attention has moved to algorithms which can be run on the machines that exist now, known as NISQ (Noisy Intermediate Scale Quantum computer). These devices require circuits of shallow depth (i.e., a reduced number of processing steps or gates, which does not require too much coherence) and are robust against errors. This can be achieved by hybrid circuits, which integrate quantum and classical computing.
",

    "## Variational methods\n",
    "A major class of hybrid algorithms is that made of variational circuits, which are built with parametric circuits, which depend of parameters that can be optimized by classical techniques. Parametric circuits can be thought of as families of circuits. A particular choice for the values of the parameters defines one member of the family.
",
    "\n",
    "A variational hybrid algorithm uses a quantum device to compute the value of an objective or cost function $C(\\bar{\\theta})$ for a given set of real parameters $\\bar{\\theta}$. To do that the quantum device implements a parametric circuit $U( \\bar{ \\theta} )$ that prepares a state $U( \\bar{ \\theta} )|\\psi_0\\rangle=|\\psi(\\bar{\\theta})\\rangle$, where $|\\psi_0\\rangle $ is an initial state independent of the parameterization, and then performs a measurement using a Hamiltonian projection operator.\n",
    "A classical processor feeds the quantum circuit the $\\theta$'s and treats the quantum circuit as a black box function that is iteratively queried until the optimum is found for a set $\\bar{\\theta_o}$ . The quality of this optimum, i.e. how well does the solution of the parametric method approach the solution of the original problem, or objective function, depends on the choice of the parametrisation.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Once we have $\\bar{\\theta_o}$ , we can create  $U(\\bar{\\theta_o})|\\psi_0\\rangle=|\\psi(\\bar{\\theta_o})\\rangle$. By sampling this state we obtain a bitstring which, with high probability, is close to the optimum of the objective function. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the end we are not after the optimum expectation value, but after the quantum state that is associated with that value as it codes the bitstring that we are after. The bitstring is the solution, not the circuit parameters or the expectation value of the cost function."

At the same we did not use a true quantum algorithm, as the computation of the expectation value was based on an explicit computation of H through the wavefunctionsimulator. So essentially we did a classical exhaustive calculation off all the eigenvalues. When the number of qbits increases it is exactly this calculation that because impossible on a classical device and we need to switch over a quantum machine. \n",

In thise case we better use a gradient-free method like ' COBYLA' or 'Nelder-Mead' a our classical optimization algorithm. The probabilistic nature of our quantum output will produce ' noisy' derivatives that will confuse algorithms that rely on a gradient calculation, like the 'L-BFGS-B' algorithm.\n",
